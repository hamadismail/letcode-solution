# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems in C++ and Java.

## Running the Code

**C++:**

The C++ solutions can be compiled and run using your preferred C++ compiler. 

**Java:**

1. **Local Execution:**
    * Rename the Java solution file to `solution.java`.
    * Compile the code using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac solution.java`).
    * Run the code using the `java` command (e.g., `java solution`).

2. **LeetCode Submission:**
    * LeetCode typically removes the `main` method before evaluating your code. 
    * Ensure your solution functions correctly without the `main` method included in your submission.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute solutions to new LeetCode problems by following these steps:

1. Create a new folder for the LeetCode problem.
2. Inside the folder, create two files:
    * `solution.cpp` (for C++ solution)
    * `solution.java` (for Java solution)
3. Implement the solution code in the respective files.
4. Add a README.md file to the problem folder if necessary (e.g., for specific instructions).
5. Submit a pull request to add your solution to the repository.
